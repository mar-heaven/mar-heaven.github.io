This is the first National Day after the pandemic, and I met some friends whom I haven't seen in a year or two. I took the opportunity to go to Beijing and have a meal with a friend I made this year.

During the National Day holiday, I drove with friends to Wutai Mountain. Since the car was an automatic transmission, it stalled several times on the mountain roads, but fortunately, we safely reached the mountain top in the end. Wutai Mountain attracted many tourists, including those from Beijing, Guangdong, and other southern provinces. The entire journey was filled with people.
