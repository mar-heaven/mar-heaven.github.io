I was using ssh to clone a repo from Github on wsl, and http proxy not work.

### Work with ssh config

edit file **~/.ssh/config**
```
Host github.com
    Hostname github.com
    ServerAliveInterval 55
    ForwardAgent yes
    ProxyCommand nc -x 127.0.0.1:7890 %h %p
```

### Work with http/https
update **~/.gitconfig**

```
[http]
[http "https://github.com"]
	proxy = http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxy.server.com:port
	sslVerify = false
sslVerify setting is not necessary.
```

**Notes**:
If you only need access github by the way of ssh+git, you needn't set any proxy in ~/.gitconfig and run git config --global http.proxy ... and similar commands at all
