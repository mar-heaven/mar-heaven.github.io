This week, I took a day off and used the time to renew my Hong Kong and Macau travel permit. It's been five years since I first obtained the permit, and due to the COVID situation, I haven't had the chance to visit Hong Kong. I'm planning to go there for a weekend hike soon.

While on the subway, I watched the TV series "BRUSH UP LIFE" which is really well-made. Sometimes, I find myself thinking that if I had the chance to live again, I might attempt things I didn't have the courage to do before. I spent several hours delving into the source code of Kubernetes, focusing particularly on the code for the apiserver and kubelet components. Kubernetes is indeed a fantastic open-source project.
