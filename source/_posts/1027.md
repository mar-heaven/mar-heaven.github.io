I have taken a guitar lesson for 2 weeks, from half a month ago, I started playing guitar as before. There are some interesting friends at the milk tea shop on Saturday, someone sings songs well, and someone plays musical instruments well, I'm glad to enjoy music.

Labour Day is coming soon, and  my roommate asked me if there are any places there are not to crowded and fun to go to. Last year we went to a small island, but I haven't decided where to go this time yet. I was thinking of just relaxing in Beijing, but there isn't much to do there. There's a good chance we'll just stay in Guangdong province this year.
