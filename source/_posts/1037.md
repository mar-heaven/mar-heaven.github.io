There is a fantastic series of videos in Youtube called [Astronomy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sViAwfeMjV0&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtPAJr1ysd5yGIyiSFuh0mIL), it talks about  topics of black hole, planets, starts and galaxies, and even the eventual **fate** of the Universe.
Science must be honest, Understanding that our understanding might be wrong is **essential**, and trying to **figure out** the ways we may be mistaken is the only way that science can help us to find our way to the truth.We meander a bit as we use it, but **in the long run** we get ever closer to understanding reality, and that is the *strength* of science.*Whether you know or not*, **you're soaking in** science.

You're a **primate**.You have **mass**.**Mitochondria** in your cells are generating energy.**Presumably**, you are breathing **oxygen**.
