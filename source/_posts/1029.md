I got infected with the novel coronavirus at the beginning of this month. Last month, I informed my friends in the northern region that I would be returning there for a week's vacation at the end of the month, and also planned to visit them. However, due to the virus, this plan had to be postponed until the end of June.


As mentioned before, I have now achieved automated deployment of the project on AWS. The next step is to utilize caching to accelerate the build process. However, progress has been a bit slow recently due to some physical discomfort. I have been focusing on studying Linux system-related topics lately.
