From this report, i just start writing in English as much as possible.
I had a short but insightful conversation with a fellow open-source enthusiast over the phone. As mentioned in my year-end review, I felt that my involvement in open-source projects had decreased in 2022 compared to 2021 (partly due to maintaining my company's open-source projects). This year, I plan to sacrifice some of my social time to invest my energy in more active open-source projects, and try to shift discussions about PRs and issues from WeChat to email for better asynchronicity.

### 6km
On Wednesday, I listened to an episode of GGTalk podcast and decided to run 2km more than my usual 4km, but stopped because I had to work the next day. I hope to achieve the goal of running a half-marathon distance at one time this year.
