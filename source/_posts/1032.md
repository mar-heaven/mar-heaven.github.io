It's been a while since I went for a run, but this week I'm gradually getting back to my previous level of exercise. I've been indulging in hotpot and barbecue lately, and my weight reached nearly 137 pounds. Although it's still within the normal range, but I want to control it at 135 pounds to avoid excessive weight gain from consuming too many snacks. So, once it goes over 135, I'll start running.

I've been following a star photographer, Ziyi Ye, who has been traveling around the world alone for 18 years to capture solar eclipses. I really admire such a girl. I often watch documentaries about the universe, but in Shenzhen, it's almost impossible to see the stars. When I saw the solar eclipse video she took, I was amazed.

I attended Zhou Chuanxiong's concert for the first time, and I really love his songs. Before this, I had never spent money to attend a concert, I'm looking forward to him coming to Shenzhen again!

I helped my colleague with some issues related to argoCD and Istio while planning to optimize our company's release system by replacing the current CLI with a more convenient web page.
