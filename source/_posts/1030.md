I found 2 platforms to practive English speaking skill, one is Discord,and the other one is Trancy.On Discord you can have conversations with people all over the world, most of them are students from Asia, I can only understand part of what they're saying. For Trancy offers various dialogue scenarios for practice, such as healthy eating, gaming, and entertainment.

I have gained a lot of weight recently due to consuming too many snacks. I need to control it. Almost half of this year has already passed, and my reading record on Notion has only added one entry. It's likely that my reading volume this year will be only half of what it was last year. I plan to spend more time reading in the remaining six months. Steve mentioned a few days ago that he will be going to Japan for work in July or August. I can catch up with him and hang out when I visit Japan afterward.
