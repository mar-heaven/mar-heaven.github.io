This week, I focused on learning the networking part of Docker, an area I had limited knowledge of before. I also took some time to set up the Jenkins service for our company's testing environment, because of the convenience of Helm, it took me approximately 2 hours to complete the setup. Additionally, I took a look at Kubernetes' Watch-List mechanism.

On Sunday, I went hiking up YangTai Mountain with a former colleague. It had been a while since I last went hiking, around April. Unfortunately, the summit was covered in clouds, so I didn't get to enjoy the scenery as much as I had hoped.
