It has passed a month since I go hiking last time. I took 6 hours across the "dong xi chong" and then back to the beginning place with my frend on Saturday. At several monthes ago, I ran 4 kilometers every day, however, after a 6-kilometer attempt, my body couldn't adapt. And one day a person told me that i looked fat than before suddenly, although I never deliberately try to lose weight, I want to maintain a normal appearance. So I decided to resume running 5 kilometers every day as before.
