It has been three weeks since the last time I wrote a weekly report. Recently, I've been wanting to go back to the northern region to visit my family. A few days ago, I told my leader that I would be taking a week off. I will be flying to Beijing on the 27th of this month to meet my brother and sister, and then go to my hometown.

Recently, I have been studying AWS platform and GitHub Actions for automation purposes. I plan to gradually accomplish project building, deployment, logging, tracing, and performance monitoring. If there are no other tasks, I intend to work on these during my vacation.
