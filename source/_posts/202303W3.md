In the past week,GPT-4 has gone viral on the internet, and every one around me is disscussing topics related to it.As an old movie "The Matrix" shows, AI will become increasingly powerful,i believe it will eventually take over all aspects of our lives.

I took part in  an interesting meeting on Friday night,and it was my first time participating in a meeting in English.Although my English level is average,my forign friend could still understand what i was trying to say.

When it comes to speaking English, most people worry that they can's express themselves correctly due to their poor English.However,the foreigners can still understand what they say means even if they speak poorly. 

Recently, i have been trying to use Github actions to automate my project workflow.When the code is pushed to the develop branch,it will automatically build the image and deploy the service on EC2.In the future, i still need to address issuess related to service load balancing and discovery.
