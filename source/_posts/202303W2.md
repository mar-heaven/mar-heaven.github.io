I went skiing with friend on Saturday, now i can control the speed easily.The last time we went skiing in Guangzhou was in 2021.
After skiing, we had barbecue. After a night's rest, we went to play tennis with friends the next day.

This week i spent some time learning about Golang's concurrency features.By the way, I learned about the nft implementation of blockchain.

Reading book 《坏蛋是怎样炼成的》，it has pass 15 years since i read it first time.Once i feel be lack of power, i will reread this novel.
