### "New Friend" Rain
Like *Steve*, I also met *Rain* through project collaboration. Recently, he attended a web3 conference in Hong Kong and coincidentally came to Shenzhen to visit me. As usual, I invited *PPD*, who was heading in the same direction.

Initially, we planned to meet at a popular hotpot restaurant where I often dine with friends. However, it was too crowded on Friday, so we reluctantly settled for a Hunan restaurant nearby, which perhaps wasn't much of a compromise for them. During our time together, we discussed some news about web3. *Rain* mentioned that he had been traveling in Singapore recently, and I asked why he didn't visit Dubai, where web3 is also gaining traction. He said he might consider it if there's an opportunity. We also talked about message bots since I've been working on them lately, so we exchanged some information. *Rain* had an interview the next day, so after we finished eating, we headed home.

### 拳皇

The shop downstairs had a street fighter arcade machine by the door. I saw a guy playing King of Fighters on it. When I mentioned it to my friend, we ended up impulsively ordering one ourselves. We specifically chose the joystick style, reminiscent of the feeling of smashing skills from our childhood. When we got home, we played a few rounds, and even though my friend rarely plays games, he managed to bloodily defeat me with sheer button mashing. He suggested focusing on mastering the skills of one character, so we chose Iori Yagami to practice because of his edgy victory expression.

May Day is coming up, and friends from Chengdu invited me to western Sichuan, while I'm also considering the primitive forests of Guizhou.
